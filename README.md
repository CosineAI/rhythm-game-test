- Pick a difficulty and click “Generate Chart”.
- Press Space to start/restart.
- Controls:
  - White lanes: Z X C
  - Black lanes: S D
- Settings allow you to:
  - Adjust input offset (ms) if hits feel late/early
  - Change chart padding (ms)
  - Rebind keys (one character each)
  - Change note fall speed
  - Toggle beat gridlines (experimental)

## Features

Notes:
- Some browsers apply stricter policies when opened as `file://`. If anything behaves oddly, serve the folder over HTTP (see Quick start).
- No environment variables or server-side components are required.
